# adcirc_wavedir_plotting
 
HsDirVid aims to solve the issue of having a non-uniform mesh but still visualizing wave directions. This file makes a movie over the time-steps, so can take a while to run.
If only several images are needed, the function can be edited to provide this and will do so in a shorter run-time.

This must be run with acccess to the adcirc_util toolbox made by Brian O. Blanton: https://github.com/BrianOBlanton/adcirc_util
